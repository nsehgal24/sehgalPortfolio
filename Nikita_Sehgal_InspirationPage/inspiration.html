          <h3><a href="https://www.kaliuchis.com/">Kali Uchis</a></h3>
          <h4>Kali Uchis, a singer/songwriter originally from Virginia with American and Colombian roots, faced adversity in her pursuit of art. Despite parental disapproval, she persevered, exploring various art forms and defying genre norms in her music, which I find inspiring. Her resilience and creative versatility have shaped her into an artist I greatly admire. </h4>

          <h3><a href="https://stevenharrington.com/">Steve Harrington</a></h3>
          <h4>I appreciate Steve Harrington's art for its representation of psychedelic aesthetics, a style I've actively incorporated into my personal projects over the past year. Inspired by his use of vibrant and neon colors, Harrington's work consistently captivates my attention.</h4>

          <h3><a href="https://www.tgoodman.com/">Timothy Goodman</a></h3>
          <h4>Timothy Goodman, a graphic designer I admire, showcases remarkable skill by employing a minimalist approach within the realm of maximalism, using only black and white. Having encountered his work at SF MOMA, I found inspiration in his ability to create compelling designs within the constraints of monochromatic simplicity. </h4>
